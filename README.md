## Problem:
Smart contract on Cardano blockchain that can help in solving CORRUPTION plaguing Africa.

## Suggested Solution:
- Person A thinks of a secret word and uses its hash, and the game validator script, to lock some funds (the payment for service he/she requires) in a pay-to-script transaction output.
- Person B is provided with the secret word after doing the required service.

The validator script releases the funds only if the word is correct.
If it isn't, the funds stay locked.
